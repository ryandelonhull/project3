             <p> I am currently a student at UC Berkeley's Extension Full Stack Web Developer Certificate Program. I have BS in
              Environmental Science and Chemistry from The Evergreen State College that I received in 2011. I have passion for solving problems using logic and critical thinking. I have never been afraid big projects or big problems and have yet to meet one that I can't find a creative solution for. I like to find the beauty in an algorithm or a formula. I am ready to apply my methodical and reasoned approach to anything put in front of me.
